~~~~~MiniTwit Modification~~~~~

Updated Minitwit.py file and schema.sql file in order to deploy web app as EC2 Instances in AWS Infrastruture. 
Mapped the application to run with AWS-RDS (Relational Database Service on Amazon Web Services) rather than the 
original SQLite database of original Minitwit app and saved the modifications as an AMI(Amazon Machine Image) to deploy instances
of the minitwit app.

    ~ What is MiniTwit?

      A SQLite and Flask powered twitter clone

    ~ How do I use it?

      1. edit the configuration in the minitwit.py file or
         export an MINITWIT_SETTINGS environment variable
         pointing to a configuration file.

      2. install the app from the root of the project directory

         pip install --editable .

      3. tell flask about the right application:

         export FLASK_APP=minitwit

      4. fire up a shell and run this:

         flask initdb

      5. now you can run minitwit:

         flask run

         the application will greet you on
         http://localhost:5000/

    ~ Is it tested?

      You betcha.  Run the `python setup.py test` file to
      see the tests pass.
